## 我们的信条

我们相信工作必须变得更有成效、更有成就感、更包容。

我们清醒的时候必须做到最好的自己并满足自我的需求与欲望--而我们生活的世界往往无法提供这些。

我们相信，科技初创公司在于创造更美好未来上有至关重要的作用。通过投资于那些分享同样愿景的最好的创业公司，我们能够加快未来的来临。


## 我们的投资者，彭博资讯

彭博资讯是我们的唯一投资者。

我们感激我们的投资者所带来的许多事物：彭博资讯是一家绝无仅有的公司。彭博是一个先驱--它创建了最初的SaaS业务之一，第一个职场社交网络，并发明了许多如今被初创公司广泛采用的准则。我们希望初创企业就如同我们一样，能从彭博的榜样中得到启发。

彭博了解、尊重科技和科技公司，有独立的思想，为长期价值而创造。30年前，彭博起始于一个有当时备受争议的想法--即金融市场的信息应该可被更广泛地获取。彭博现在达到了全球性的规模和影响力，在近200个地方拥有超过1.5万名员工，但它依旧是一家由创始人持有的私人公司。

为什么彭博资讯要创建Bloomberg Beta？彭博希望有一扇窗口能进入初创公司的世界，以便尽早地理解将带来深刻影响力的趋势，并在某些未来会变得伟大的创始人和公司还远未被大众所知道前就发现他们。要做到这一点，彭博希望找到一种方式来支持创始人，并与他们合作，而不是仅仅是普通的商业关系。(许多初创公司还没有准备好与彭博资讯，或任何一家成熟、有规模的公司合作。直到某一天，它们逐渐成长壮大，确定了方向，并最终决定把合作关系作为优先事项。而这可能是在公司成立后的好几年才会发生。)

彭博投资Bloomberg Beta，打开了这扇窗，接触到了这些初创公司，并建立了一种在战略投资部门中罕见的结构--一只真正的基于财务回报而投资的基金，而不是另一个“运营部门”。彭博知道，伟大的创始人希望投资者的利益与自己的利益完全一致。

因此，Bloomberg Beta选择自己的投资，并完全根据初创公司的指标和财务回报潜力来决定是否支持，而不管它们是否与彭博有(或打算)有业务关系。我们专注于那些与彭博相关的领域--比如，我们不会投资于视频游戏或消费者电子商务。一种理解我们投资的方式是：我们专注于工作的未来。

我们相信我们可以将彭博资讯的价值观应用于我们与创始人合作的方式：客户(创始人！)优先，在我们的领域(工作的未来)钻研积累深入的专业知识，并结合不同的领域(从生活的方方面面)为我们的客户带来新的体验。

毕竟，彭博资讯的创始人们成功地做到了我们希望帮助其他公司完成的事情--创造非凡的事物。

## 我们关于工作的未来所坚信的
要了解我们的基金是如何运作的，了解我们在每次会议中带去的观点、发送的每一封电子邮件、关于创业的每一个想法都是有帮助的。我们一直在努力阐明其中的一些信念--包括那些关于整体经济的准绳和企业未来如何运作的本质。

#### 工作会作为新技术的土壤
我们的个人生活如今由技术引导--能识别语音的厨房助理、基于云的电子邮件、自动泊车的汽车、即时配送的商品和服务--远比我们在工作中使用的更加先进。在过去的20年里，与现代经济史上的许多不同的是，技术往往在进入工业之前就先进入了人们的个人生活。

我们相信，工作领域的变革将迎头赶上，我们将回到历史常态，即科技在影响家庭生活前之前会先改变工作环境。工作--尤其是知识工作--将成为许多最令人兴奋的新技术的土壤，特别是[许多](https://textio.com/)[不同](https://digitalgenius.com/)[机器](https://gradescope.com/)[学习](http://www.diffbot.com/)[的类别](https://www.gridspace.com/)，将发现它们最有趣的应用。想象一下所有将被更现代化方式改变的那些行业吧。

#### 加快技术变革的步伐
我们相信，科技的步伐虽然已经在加快，但将会以一种更深刻的方式影响我们：变化，一旦发生，会变得超乎想象的突然和应接不暇。从一个由猎人和采集者组成的人类社会到一个农业社会花了大约3,000年；从农业社会过渡到工业社会的过渡经历了大约300年；从工业社会到服务型社会用了大约30年。无论接下来发生什么，都会在今天工作的人的职业生涯中发生。现在，整个行业或行业领先的公司都可能瞬间跌落悬崖。1958年时，如果一家公司被纳入标准普尔500指数，它预计能存在61年--当今，预期只剩下[18年](https://www.highly.co/hl/573f63e821341a003c00002c)。

#### 哑铃效应
我们相信，一些初创公司(以及一些往往高度重视科技，视之为首要竞争力的成熟企业)会在危机中寻找到机会。他们将完全取代现行的商业运作方式--至关重要的[交流系统](https://slack.com/)，[文化])(https://bonus.ly/)，商业模式、领导力和许多长期重视的假设。[一些](https://layer.com/)[将])(https://www.dominodatalab.com/)[供应](https://www.pathgather.com/)[技术])(https://www.prosperworks.com/)给其他公司，而有些将会从零开始搭建全新的模式，以[直接](https://www.flexport.com/)[竞争对手](https://angel.co/)的身份闯入市场。

随着尘埃逐渐落定，行业头部赢家将占据整个行业的更多份额，而中游的玩家将消失。大公司的规模将变得更大，小公司将变得更小，但依旧能够为自己、它们的所有者以及员工提供一个完好的生活。

##### 像程序员一样工作
这些变化对人类的影响将是难以想象的。对于工作的人来说，我们相信他们的工作会演化地更像是软件工程师一般，(自动化任务和利用电脑[灵活的](https://arimo.com)[能力](http://graphistry.com/)完成[工作](https://alation.com/)，以及证券交易员全天候根据[量化](https://orbitalinsight.com/)[数据](http://txn.com/)行事。我们相信，许多个人将来会通过全自动化决策型软件协助完成工作。因此，许多人将面临今天困扰许多软件工程师的[创作者 vs. 管理者](http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html)的两难困境。这些人才将[带来](https://howdy.ai/)[他们的](https://www.buddybuild.com/)[自有的])(https://influxdata.com/)[工具](https://www.scalyr.com/)(不仅仅是他们的设备)，坚持表示这些[软件](https://virgilsecurity.com/)和[做事方法](https://launchdarkly.com/)使他们更加高效。

#### 无人的新型公司
职业生涯将来不会像一条直线，而更像是一种不同[活动](https://gigster.com/)形成的[组合](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions)，人们根据自己的工作和[能力](https://www.codecademy.com/)而决定，而非他们过往的机构关系(无论教育还是职场)。在某些情况下，人们会将收入与工作区分开来，并以如今人们无法想象职场发展的方式将他们的生活和工作结合在一起。他们的个人、经济、社会、地理和人口背景也将比当今公认的人才更加多样化。

#### 个体的重要性
随着人们工作方式的不断变化，这意味着[超级英雄式的](https://www.masterclass.com/)单一人才时代才刚刚到来。一个人在工作中将变得更加[有效率](https://askwonder.com)，很快我们将看到[一人创造十亿美金价值的](http://www.businessinsider.com/is-a-one-man-billion-dollar-startup-on-the-horizon-2015-5)公司。这些人将会创造全新的产业并推翻既有的那些存在。他们仅需要相对很小的资本(无论是资金还是其他方面)就能达到全新的高度。他们是那些我们希望[能尽早发现](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/02/upshot/the-next-mark-zuckerberg-is-not-who-you-might-think.html？_r=0)，给予他们信任与资金，并在他们达到逃逸速度时为他们欢呼。

## 我们在初创公司中所寻找的

We recognize that seeing early signs of an outlier is hard, and nobody’s cracked how to do it reliably. What we want is a reason to tell ourselves that a startup has a chance to be extraordinary. There are a few areas where we search for signs: certain qualities of a founding team, an early product, areas where we think we can be helpful, and the right moment in a company’s life.  Here is a [complete list](https://github.com/Bloomberg-Beta/Manual/blob/master/3%20-%20Criteria%20for%20investing.md) of the questions we ask ourselves when evaluating startups. 

我们明白，发现异类的踪迹是很困难的，至今也没有任何人琢磨出如何可靠的方法。我们想要的仅是一个我们能说服自己一家初创公司有机会成就伟大的理由。以下是我们寻找蛛丝马迹的领域：创始团队的某些品质，一个早期产品，我们认为自己可以帮到的领域，以及公司生命周期中的一个适当时机。这是一个我们在评估初创企业时会问自己的问题的[完整列表](https://github.com/Bloomberg-Beta/Manual/blob/master/3%20-%20Criteria%20for%20investing.md)。


### 创始人

我们寻找一个相信一个创始团队能成就非凡的理由。不是说他们必须已经具备完美的技能或经验来匹配他们想要建立的事业(这往往是是商业计划书中“团队”页倾向于聚焦的方面)，而是他们拥有成就伟大的潜力。

是什么会让我们觉得创始人可能是非同寻常的？通常情况下，他们只是有一种不寻常的心理--他们认为自己与众不同，看到别人所看不到的宏大趋势，对规范漠不关心，并且可能有一个异常高的痛苦阈值。我们的灵感来自Michael Dearing对创始人认知歪曲能力的描述([pdf](http://quarry.stanford.edu/xapm1111126lse/docs/02_LSE_Cognitive.pdf)，[vid](https://www.harrisonmetal.com/library/the-cognitive-distortions-of-founders))。我们放弃某些公司，因为我们认为创始人们还不足够疯狂--他们看起来太过教科书了。(我们并不是指他们的外表或背景，我们指的是他们决心的程度、尝试的意愿或洞察力。)

我们相信，那些注定会成就非凡的创始人，对最优秀的人才和公司发展所需要的资金能产生天然的吸引力，而且我们发现自己会愿意为他们工作(毕竟，如果我们的确投资的话，我们就会为他们工作)。他们把融资视作在某些特定时候搭建某些业务时所需要采取的行动之一，而不是一个必须项或要赢得的徽章。无论他们是否从风险资本募集了资金，他们都会持续以自己的方式去解决他们选择的问题。他们坚信，一家伟大的公司需要生生不息的文化和不同寻常的执行力才能成为异类--并且甚至在开始发展企业之前就已经开始融合这样的思想。这样做通常意味着将他们的团队集中在一个(或最多两个)位置，认识到分布式团队的已知上限仍然比较低，而且面对面的沟通始终是一种更富有适应力的合作模式。

即使在了解到不少其他团队可能正在着手他们之前以为是独有的新点子的时候，他们依旧胸有成竹。即使其他人（包括我们）告诉他们这个点子不值一晒，他们依旧坚持付诸行动把想法变成现实。他们都认为自己是独一无二的，并把许多公司列为自己的竞争对手。

许多时候我们支持创始人都是源于[信任](https://also.roybahat.com/the-trust-thing-691791a4c6ca)的--我们所投资的许多公司都是由我们认识多年，逐渐建立信任的人所领导的。如果我们不了解你，我们希望至少某个我们信任的人了解你。否则，我们很难仅仅根据一两面之后的印象信任你；第一印象往往是不可靠的。尽管如此，我们也支持过那些我们刚刚认识的创始人--有时候你“就是知道”。

我们还对创始人进行背景调查，搜索公开记录。几乎每个人都有各种各样更多事情把挖掘出来，这很正常。有人被起诉，事情无常。一些历史上最好的创始人有着复杂的过去。只有当我们发现某些可能会影响我们之间的信任的重要事情时，问题就出现了，而我们需要通过与创始人的对话来解决这些问题。

### 包容与多元化

我们致力于让各种背景的人在[初创世界](https://www.inclusionintech.com/)都感到被欢迎--从我们自己的团队，到我们服务的创始团队，以及他们创办的公司。初创公司首先需要重新审视世界，而不同背景的人对世界的看法也不同--因此，如果我们想要改变事物，我们就需要让尽可能广泛背景的人参与进来。

我们积极主动地从传统未被足够重视的社群中寻找潜在的合适创始人。我们广义地定义多元化，包括先天与后天的多种形式，如性别、种族、族裔、性取向、年龄、社会经济地位、地理、国籍、教育等。

我们为我们团队的多元化感到自豪(例如，我们合作人的比例是男女各占一半，而我们的团队有一半以上的女性)。我们认为集体思维在风险投资中是危险的，而不同的背景才能带来不同的见解。而一个多元化且包容的团队给团队给其中的每一个也带来了更好的体验。

尽管如此，我们仍然觉得团队在支持有代表性不足群体背景的创始人方面做得还不足。例如，在我们所投资的CEO中，只有10%是女性，在过去两年中我们支持的创始团队中，只有25%包括一名女性创始人。我们希望能准确跟踪其它形式的多元化因素，但我们因为避免强制性要求创始人向我们提交任何其它相关数据，因此这极有难度。(我们很难为未来的投资组合设定一个合理的目标：一方面，我们希望这个目标是我们能够控制和实现的，另一方面，任何低于50%的目标感觉都是不足，而唯一最为重要的目标是我们投资的公司。)

我们相信进步是通过日积月累的点滴决策逐步早就的-[信任的建立需要时间的沉淀](http://also.roybahat.com/post/91847335194/the-trust-thing)。所以我们必须现在就采取行动。具体而言：
+ Future Founders Community是我们挖掘新创始人最主要的途径，我们通过数据来预测谁会创办企业。我们[Future Founders社群远比](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/02/upshot/the-next-mark-zuckerberg-is-not-who-you-might-think.html?_r=0)当前的由风投支持的创始人人群更加多元化(比如，我们的社群包含28%女性，但当然我们希望能逐渐提高到50%)。
+ 作为我们在做投资决策时考量的因素中，我们只投资[那些我们认为能能力创造一个多元化且包容的公司的创始人](https://github.com/Bloomberg-Beta/Manual/blob/master/3%20-%20Criteria%20for%20investing.md#founders-and-team-2)。如果我们支持的一家初创公司未能建设出一种多样化和包容性的文化，那么无论公司从财务角度如何成功，我们都会感到遗憾。
+ 我们举办线上的开放“办公时间”--只针对那些来自代表性不足背景的创始人。从PT时间的周五下午1点到下午2点，你都可以在推特上私信[基金管理人](http://twitter.com/roybahat)，我们会非常乐意安排时间和你通过电话或者文字交流。
+ 目前我们每个月积极考虑投资的包含女性创始人的公司数量几乎翻了一番(从每月5家增加到9家)。尽管我们希望将这一比例提高到一半，目前是30%。(我们所说的“积极考虑”，指的是在我们发出投资意向之前的阶段-我们和创始人至少见过一次面，并开始做一些尽调。)
+ 当应邀在行业活动上发表演讲时，我们会询问是否有来自代表性不足的社群的代表人一同参与(例如，在同一个座谈会)。
+ 当我们主办我们自己的活动时，我们会审核邀请名单成员的多元化。(看，例如，我们[专注研究科技对于工作的未来会带来怎样影响的常年委员会](https://shiftcommission.work/findings-of-shift-the-commission-on-work-workers-and-technology-a071bc169df0))
+ 我们每年举办主题为打造多元化与包容团队的“[Turpentine Talk](https://www.highly.co/hl/56e6f2323533356aeb5a0000)”(大约每个月我们投资组合里的创始人会相互交流公司战术策略)
+ 我们是[theBoardlist](https://theboardlist.com/our-community)的创始成员，致力帮助公司找到女性董事会成员。
+ 我们正在参与[#MovingForward](https://wearemovingforward.github.io), 加入其他VC的行列，共同投入鼓励打造一个多元化、包容和无骚扰的工作场所。
+ 我们通过Opportunity Hub赞助了一项奖学金，让来自代表性不足背景的一名学生前往参加SXSW。
+ 我们将至少每年一次更新我们在这里发布的业绩指标(例如，关于我们投资组合中CEO的性别组成)。

我们认为自己需要兑现自己的承诺。作为一种衡量指标，如果一位创始人对我们的基金或团队有一件，创始人可以直接向彭博资讯的代表Drew Gulley--drew.gulley@bloombergbeta.com--投诉。我们要对我们的资金来源负责，我们也同样遵守彭博资讯服务客户的[政策](https://data.bloomberglp.com/company/sites/39/2018/04/2017-Appendix.pdf)

我们坚信，当更多不同的观点能出现在桌上时，企业的社群才会更加强大，并能够积极参与创建一个更具包容性和多样性的科技行业。

### 产品和市场

我们更喜欢在一些早期市场上非常成功的产品，而非那些尽管已经数量庞大但在用户生活中却不起重要作用的产品。彭博最初只为美国政府债券提供债券价格表。我们希望一个产品至少对它的一些用户是最重要的服务。

我们喜欢那些自己会使用且能理解的产品。我们团队的成员包括曾经的科技买家，软件开发人员，创始人，初级员工，当然还是许多媒体的消费者--所以我们可以使用和理解的产品范围很广。这些产品通常从一种被充分理解的技术的特定应用场景开始，而不是一个正在寻找应用场景的多行业“黑匣子”技术。

我们相信那些注定会成就伟大的初创企业，在他们最初的时期，会选择...
+ 专注一种销售模式，一般要么是直接售卖给个人，或者是直接卖给公司(尽管很多认为他们一开始就可以同时做到这两种方式)
+ 集中精力在一种类型的人(例如，在客户公司中的角色)为客户，避免试图用同一种工具为技术性和非技术性用户服务
+ 业务正在蓬勃发展的目标客户的，特别避免那些在低增长或无增长，或低利润企业的客户(例如，大多数线上出版社)

如果一个产品推出了，我们关心它做得有多好--著名的“受欢迎度”--但我们倾向于不关注具体的数字。我们关注的是逐月增长率(或者，在早期情况下，每周增长情况)，会询问不同用户群体的行为，并试图了解每个用户的行为(该产品对单一用户带来的真正价值有多少)。在早期阶段，我们最感兴趣的是能佐证客户热爱的证据--比如留存率或强度指标，净推荐值NPS，甚至是客户对产品的具体赞美案例。

### 投资轮次

我们强烈倾向成为公司的第一笔融资，并在创业尽可能早期的阶段投资。如果一家初创公司为了从我们基金融资而注册公司，非常好。如果你还没有创立公司是否应该联系我们？[当然](https://github.com/Bloomberg-Beta/Manual/blob/master/1%20-%20Manual.md#beacon)。

这并不是基于一种理性的投资考量(可以说，在投资更大额度，更迟阶段投入时，面临的竞争较小)--而是我们的投资风格偏好。早期投资与其说是一笔交易，不如说更是基于一种关系。出于某些特定原因，我们确实会作出非常规决策(例如，我们无法抗拒某个创始人或公司)。

“第一笔投资”并不一定意味着那一轮的领投方--有时我们是唯一的投资者，有时是众多投资者中的一个。有时创始人会设定投资条款，有时是另一位投资者，有时是我们自己。我们对此不太在意。当我们愿意投资的时候，我们就愿意洽谈达成一致；而其他投资者是否会如此则取决于自身。

我们非常乐意投资于那些可能需要很长时间才能证明他们所做的事情的公司--我们的投资者彭博资讯(Bloomberg)抱有几十年的长远眼光，并且愿意为长远发展而努力。我们没有固定的时限要求从未我们的投资中获得回报。事实上，我们更喜欢那些为业绩而不断拼搏的公司。

### 地理位置

伟大可以从任何地方诞生。不过，我们是一支规模不大的团队，而且我们相信只有在初创企业附近时才能帮上忙。初创企业依赖于信任，如果不花时间面对面一起交流沟通，就很难建立起信任。这意味着我们专注于自己团队所在的这两个城市，旧金山和纽约。我们在这两个地方都有着深厚的根基，所以我们才有办法引入那些更有能力提供帮助的当地人，毕竟我们只想投资那些我们认为自己可以提供不成比例帮助的领域。我们会考虑在立足于其他地方的投资(例如，如果某个地区有一种专长，就像一些地区对于安全初创企业至关重要)，但这对我们来说的确是更难。

对于那些总部设立在上述两个城市，而早期市场却是其它地方的初创公司，也是如此(例如，成立于旧金山的一家公司专注于在印度做一些事情)。我们认为公司应该尽可能接近他们的客户，我们想要深入了解一家初创公司的潜在客户--当它瞄准远离我们专业知识和关系的市场的客户时，这是很困难的。

我们在旧金山和纽约之外的地区投资了几次(DC、多伦多、西雅图、波士顿、奥斯汀等)，但我们需要一个特殊的理由(通常是在我们已经了解和信任团队的时候)。我们组织了[几个](https://www.recode.net/2018/3/30/17177834/midwest-heartland-bus-tour-comeback-cities-rust-belt-safari-vc-venture-capital-founders-washington) 关于新兴初创市场的[活动](https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/11/placing-bets-beyond-the-venture-hubs-of-new-york-and-silicon-valley/) (又称“Comeback Cities” tours)，我们与风投公司、国会议员一起参观，并了解在那里投资需要做些什么--我们仍在探索能否在其他市场实现我们提供给投资组合里的创始人的服务标准。

### 来源

We find investments in many ways, but our favorite is for founders we have already backed to refer other founders.

Founders are our customers, and we believe in doing more than waiting to be introduced to them -- we want to get to know them early. So we have developed a model in partnership with the Lester Center for Entrepreneurship at UC Berkeley’s Haas School of Business (based on data from AngelList and others) to predict who are the people in Silicon Valley and New York statistically most likely to become founders, who haven't yet -- our ["Future Founders"](https://medium.com/@roybahat/predicting-who-will-start-a-company-5dab8efc7dd4#.opjjsuvue) group. We reach out to these individuals to form relationships with them, and encourage them to form relationships with each other.

After that, we are most likely to invest in companies that come to us through someone we trust. Several of those have come our way through referrals from the staff at Bloomberg -- this creates an instant “customer reference,” often from someone whose judgment we respect.

We don’t really find companies, we mostly find founders. We tend to ask people we trust who are the 1-2 most exceptional people you’ve met, whether in school or at work, or in some other way -- and then we get to know those people. We hope that some of those people evolve to be great founders, and we’d like to know them whether or not they do.

We also try a lot of products. Our phones have many, many apps installed. And we read. We reach out to people and companies whose products we like, or who we read about.

We keep track of companies we’ve been in touch with -- just like we’d hope that our companies do, we have an organized system for our outreach. In general, we try to run our fund with the same tools our companies use.

### “主题”

Our focus is investing in startups that improve work -- and knowledge work in particular.

We have doubts about the effectiveness of theme-based investing. The best founders can surprise an investor with an unexpected take on a category. That said, there are areas our team has grown to care about and learn about. We only want to invest in companies where we believe we have enough understanding to be enormously valuable to our founders, and to have good enough judgment to support founders through thick and thin. 

[Machine intelligence](http://www.shivonzilis.com/machineintelligence) crosses all the areas we care about, and we have treated it as our main interest area for several years now. We believe machine intelligence will transform every industry and every function -- and we focus on its effects on business. We believe [machine intelligence will be like electricity](http://www.wired.com/2014/10/future-of-artificial-intelligence/): cheap, convenient, and on-demand. We want to back the founders ushering this future into the now.

Areas where we’ve invested include: content discovery, cybersecurity, data sets and services, developer tools, full-stack startups who use technology to compete in a new way, hardware, human-computer interaction, learning, media distribution, new organizational models, open source software, productivity tools, professional networks, real estate, technology platforms, workflow tools, workplace communication.

We avoid investments in financial services companies that intend to compete with Bloomberg clients.

Sometimes founders mistakenly assume that we avoid “consumer” companies entirely. There are many individual-facing businesses that we’d fund -- they just need to help a person at work. (Typically “enterprise” businesses sell to a company, and these individual-facing services sell to the end user directly.) Ask us if you are unsure if you fit in our scope!

We do avoid, for example, e-commerce and entertainment because they tend to serve people outside their work capacity. There are also other areas that intersect with the future of work where we know too little to be confident, e.g., retail, travel, local, heavy industry, and medical services. We also believe we play a role in how the future of work evolves, so we'll (politely) pass on investing in what may be highly successful companies but don't fit into a vision of a world we want to live in.

### “创业计划书”

A demo is 50 times more useful than slides. One is a description of a thing, the other is the thing itself. We look at your demo [the way a new user would](http://also.roybahat.com/post/82904179747/why-most-demos-confuse).

We cringe at the idea of founders spending lots of time making fundraising presentations. When we see “v36” in the filename of a presentation, it bothers us. That said, we do value the work founders do writing down their plans for their company, because it gives us a sense of:
* How the team thinks
* How well the team communicates
* Whether, if we don’t know the team, we should spend the time to meet in person

If you use a presentation to sell your product to customers, we're as interested in that pitch as in your fundraising pitch.

There is no standard format we like, but we probably spend 2-5 minutes reading a deck when we are deciding whether to meet a company. How many slides? Depends, but if you need 20 detailed pages to tell your story, that's likely more than we can absorb.

In roughly one-fifth of our portfolio companies, we never saw a deck before investing -- usually because the product spoke so loudly for itself, or we knew the team and business so well we didn’t need a deck.

In some cases, where we know the team well, we’ve helped founders (even before we decide whether to invest) write their deck for other investors.

In day-zero companies, we don't pay much attention to your milestones -- if you are in the discovery phase, trying to figure out what works, you'll generally be unable to predict where you will be beyond two months from now.

We do care about what metrics you intend to track -- what experiments are you running, what hypotheses is your first product testing -- and if there is one metric you care about more than any other.

We also ignore, in most cases, long-term financial projections -- except to the extent that they show what the “unit economics” (revenue and cost from a single user or customer) need to be for the business to work. If you fail to invent assumptions that make the overall business wildly profitable in a few years, then you probably should be doing something else for a living.

That said, we do care about the short-term financial plan, especially on the choices founders directly control. How many people do you intend to hire, where will you spend the money? This helps us figure out how much time you will have before you need more capital, and how far we believe you can get in that amount of time. We prefer to see early-stage companies spending their capital on building product.

Put another way, a five-year financial plan is mostly useless for early stage companies -- a monthly plan for the next twelve months and a quarterly plan for the next two years could be very useful. 

We would love to see all of it, whether perfect or otherwise so give us anything you've already made -- financial model, deck, background materials. It helps us make sure our conversation is more dialogue than exposition.

### 面对面会议

Once we’re meeting in person, you can often leave the laptop closed. We’re trying to get a sense of you as a founder, ask you hard questions and see how you respond.

If your product is public, you should assume when you walk into the room that we’ve spent the time to play with it.

Some things we tend to say, ask, or think in meetings:
* We don’t put great faith in the value of advice (including, often, our own) -- the world of users and customers has more to teach a company than any smart, well-intentioned person.
* What makes you an outlier? (Do you know what makes your company a potential outlier?)
* Why is this problem important to you, and how will things be better if you succeed?
* What was the last important skill you learned? (We believe great founders are, paradoxically, both self-confident and exceptionally good learners -- so constantly in need of improvement.) What was the last thing you were wrong about?
* What do you want out of your investors other than money? (We’re trying to figure out if we can be uniquely helpful.)
* If a dozen other companies are creating a company right now with this exact idea, how could you still succeed?
* Who will you pick as your [first customers](https://also.roybahat.com/picking-your-first-customers-the-gradient-of-influence-47858b90adfd)? (This tends to be, in our view, one of the most important early choices founders make.) Who was the last potential customer you spoke with? (Founders who are scared of talking to customers scare us.)
* How close do you feel you are to product-market fit? (Here, it's less that we want you to *have* product-market fit, and more that we want to understand how you think about your own progress wherever you are.)
* Are there any plans you really would like to pursue, but have stopped talking about with investors because you've been told by VCs they are bad ideas? (We often like those plans.)
* If you're successful, what potential harms might your service cause, and what will you do about that? What's been the most difficult ethical dilemma you've had at work? (Credit to our friends at [Designer Fund](http://designerfund.com) for putting in our heads some of these specific questions about the ethical side of startups.)
* For what values would you sacrifice making more money? In practice, have you sacrificed financially to live by a principle?
* How will you build a diverse and inclusive team over the next year? Given your personalities, what culture issues do you think are most likely to arise at your company?
* Why are you raising money at all? (We find there are plenty of startups who don’t actually need to raise money and, in general, that’s better for them -- even if it means we don’t get to participate.)

We try to avoid some of the, shall we say, less useful questions others ask:
* What will you do if [big scary company X] competes with you?
* Have you patented any of this?
* How does this become a $1B business?
* [How’s it going?](http://also.roybahat.com/post/62158854505/a-dumb-question-to-ask-an-entrepreneur)

Founders are sometimes surprised at how quickly our meetings move; we often will take you off your story to zero in on something we believe is a key driver. This is how we’d work with you after our investment, so you can think about whether you enjoy working with us.

At any point, we’d be happy to narrate for you our level of interest -- though you might not always like what you hear. (And remember, an 80% chance of wanting to work together still means there is a 20% chance we will not want to work together.)

Immediately after we meet, a frequent thing we need to do is just think on it -- if we find ourselves getting less excited a day or two later, that’s probably a bad sign. If we find ourselves returning to the conversation in our heads, wondering what you meant when you said such-and-such, and imagining how great the product will be, that’s a great sign.

A lot of founders wonder why investors are slow to get back to them. This is an unacceptable pattern, and yet one we’ve been guilty of from time to time. Sometimes, the reason is we’re doing work on your company (e.g., calling references, who might take a few days to get back themselves). Sometimes it’s that we’re unsure and we’re giving ourselves a few days to see if we get more excited or less as we think on it. Sometimes we just mess up and forget to reply. It’s a fail when that happens. We try to at least narrate as we go with “I know you haven’t heard from us in a few days, this is what’s happening…”

We aspire to be at the extreme end of the “we communicate openly with you” scale.

### “Doing the work” and calling references

If we decide we are going to invest, we often (but not always) go through a short cycle of working on our own view -- probing for holes in our own thinking, asking the advice of our one friend who has been thinking about this industry for 10 years, understanding other approaches that have been tried (or are current competitors), and spending as much time as we can using the product. Many of the same kinds of things we find that founders do in the early days of contemplating creating a new company.

During this period, we try to be open with the founder about whether we will call around to ask about them. We put great faith in the value of these reference calls, and even sometimes [check references before meeting a founder](https://also.roybahat.com/hiring-someone-check-references-before-you-interview-ba05c5b46e37) for the first time. We owe a debt to the friends, colleagues, and partners who are willing to share open, unvarnished views. We try to skip nonsense questions (“what are their strengths and weaknesses”) and instead focus on things that will help us decide whether to back a founder:
* How does this person compare to other founders you’ve known? Top 10%? 5%? 1%?
* What makes you believe this person is extraordinary?
* If you were us, and decided to invest in the company, in what areas would you guess this person would need the most help?

We call as many references as we can find.

### 我们如何做决策

We have an “anyone can say yes” policy. Yes, any of our team members can say yes. And no, you don’t have to meet my other partners. We believe the best founders and companies are polarizing. Our best investments might have been, originally, opposed by one or more of our partners. Teams are great at gathering information and surfacing wisdom, but terrible at making decisions. We believe in individual accountability -- if anyone can say yes, then everyone feels the weight of making a decision. (That said, we do require that before anyone says yes they mention the investment to the rest of us -- that way they get the benefit of the team’s input, and it’s a good way to slow down and think for a second.)

We value each others’ opinions and seek them out. Our team is unusual in that we don’t (yet!) have any of the “partner issues” we hear about at other funds. In other funds, it can be the worst of both worlds -- founders lack clarity about how investments get approved, and in some firms the partners become resentful of one another's power to approve each others' investments and then do little to support another partners' companies.

We believe in each others’ talents, trust each other enough not to mind when someone is wildly wrong, and enjoy each others’ views. We talk as a full group twice a week, to think out loud about companies we’ve invested in or might invest in, and we meet for a full few days once every couple of months.

Because any one of us is empowered to “yes” a deal, we all share and share alike on helping each others’ deals succeed. “Before the investment, it’s your deal; after the investment, it’s our deal.”

We have posted in public [our criteria for deciding whether to invest](https://github.com/Bloomberg-Beta/Manual/blob/master/3%20-%20Criteria%20for%20investing.md). When we talk about companies, we use those criteria. 

We’ve had investments where the founder only ever met one person on our team before we invested (though, afterward we all want to meet our companies so we can help them). In practice, each of us often asks the founders if they’d like to meet one of our other colleagues because the founders will get a better feel for us, and because we like and respect our colleagues.

We've noticed something about our "anyone says yes" approach: over time, each of us has gravitated toward different styles of companies. Some of us prefer companies before they've even incorporated, others once they've committed some code (sometimes the code happens before incorporation, that's OK, too). If you get to any one of us, we'll each have a feel for who on our team is most likely to say yes to you -- and that's the person we'll try to steer you toward.

In practice, here are your odds: we have invested in 1.5% of the companies we have spent time reviewing.

### Our deal memo

Before we invest, we write a brief “note to self” outlining our views. We do this so we can be as disciplined about our commitments as founders are about their commitments. We also share this note with a small advisory group at Bloomberg L.P.

In order of importance, we write about:
* The founders’ vision
* Our thoughts on the founding team
* Why we are excited about the company
* If the product is built, what we think of it and how well it is doing
* What we believe the company needs to do to succeed (or make the next major milestone, like a further round of funding)
* The terms of the deal
* Other stuff: competition, market size (to the extent we can tell), use of the funding, business model (in our experience it is usually either unknowable or obvious, and not worth much mental energy either way), what we learned in diligence

### 做决策需要多久

We’ve made investment decisions in the first meeting (though usually when we already knew the founder and something about what they are working on), and we’ve had cases where we get to know the founder over a period of weeks or months and watch their business evolve (often paying a higher price as we watch the founder make progress).

### Our “Service-Level Agreement”

Some firms commit to giving you an answer in a certain amount of time. We commit that at any point in time, if you ask us to narrate the likelihood of investment and timeframe, we’ll give you our best guess.

The reason we don’t have a guideline like “3 meetings in two weeks” is because that smells like a transaction, and we’d rather be in a long-term relationship with you. We take seriously the process of getting to know a founder and a company, and having the founder truly know and like us.

Many of our investments have evolved out of months or years of conversation with a founder, much of which started before Bloomberg Beta even existed. Yes, some are love at first sight -- but it’s exceedingly rare. We’re not sure which will turn out better. But would you tell someone on the first date how many times you had to date them before you decided whether to get married? It’s fundamentally unpredictable at first, but it does become clear quickly.

If you’re in a conversation with us, our policy is “do ask, do tell” -- we are happy to share with you our current sense of excitement and timing. You might have to make a decision, and we want you to know where we stand. If the elevator doors close while we are thinking on it, so be it.

We intend to always give a clear “no” with straightforward reasoning. That reasoning, while straightforward, might still be subjective (“we just didn’t get excited about this and we’re not sure why”).

## 投资交易条款

We want founders to know what to expect when they work with us before they get to the first meeting, and understanding how we think about deal contracts is an important part of that process. Our legal process is thorough, and we diligently review all documents. To help with that, we have published the templates we use for our [investment documents](https://github.com/Bloomberg-Beta/Investment-Documents). We recommend reading the accompanying [blog post](https://medium.com/@hjs/were-open-sourcing-our-investment-documents-f96b6e8c40e5), that explains these documents.

### 我们冒多大的风险

Since we bet early, and expect the vast majority of our portfolio companies to fail to return much money, our winners need to be big. We fully expect that, if we succeed, one investment will return our entire fund. So we need to believe that every company could be that investment.

We prefer enormous growth in modest markets to modest growth in enormous markets. We believe that tends to be a more reliable signal of a company's greatness -- it is harder to serve 100 customers exceptionally than to serve 10,000 customers poorly. And we learned, in part from the example of Bloomberg's growth from one category of the financial industry to another, that deeply understanding each type of customer gives you an exceptional ability to lead an industry.

### “控制”

We are [not big fans of boards](http://also.roybahat.com/post/102969262108/boreds) in day-zero companies. While we like founders having a close circle of trusted colleagues to ask for advice and we aspire to be in that trusted circle, when we imagine early-stage founders working on slide decks instead of products, it makes us feel a little ill. We'd rather be in your Slack or getting your Github notifications than having you prepare for meetings.

We also feel that the cadence of board review (every couple of months, let’s say) is mismatched to the cadence of a day-zero company (which evolves every week or two). Later on, boards can be great. If people don’t talk just to hear themselves talk, which each of us has been guilty of now and then.

More generally, we are ambivalent about whether investor control is useful at all. We’ve seen it cut both ways.

So, we generally prefer not to have a seat on a company’s board. But, that said, if the company wants us on the board, we’re open to talking about it -- and we have agreed to join boards from time to time when the founder truly wants this and has good reasons after hearing our views.

### 我们想要的权利

We care about getting pro rata rights. This means that if a founder offers another investor the opportunity to invest at a certain price, we want to invest at that price too -- at least up to the amount needed to preserve our ownership of the company.

We also want to approve of any investments you take that might get their capital repaid before ours.

We care about getting some information rights -- basically the ability for us to understand how well the company is doing, and its financials.

We go into much more detail in our public [explanation of our investment documents](https://medium.com/@hjs/were-open-sourcing-our-investment-documents-f96b6e8c40e5).

### 那些数字

Our standard first check is $500,000, though more and more often we are investing up to $1M. We want to invest enough to give a startup the money it needs to make real progress in the early days, and to attract other investors alongside us if needed. We are happy to lead, and happy to participate in rounds led by others, depending on the situation -- in earliest-stage venture, sometimes the [idea of a lead means different things to different people](http://also.roybahat.com/post/119369807637/in-earliest-stage-venture-what-is-a-lead-anyway).

In the early days of our fund, we wrote smaller checks because (like the early days of companies) we believe in burning capital slowly until you find product-market fit. (In our first year, our biggest check was $250,000.)

We have no minimum check size, and have written checks as small as $25,000, especially in what we call a ["flag" investment](https://github.com/Bloomberg-Beta/Manual/blob/master/1%20-%20Manual.md#flag).

We care about price. We avoid having a hard requirement about our ownership percentage. That said, we want to get return on our time in addition to our capital, so we generally want to be able to own a meaningful amount of a company over time. A good rule of thumb for us is that meaningful ownership means roughly 10%. We are comfortable taking the highest possible levels of risk and we believe that founders, and their investors, should be rewarded for that. (We also believe companies are successful when their teams also get generous equity grants that motivate the early team members to create something valuable.)

We also believe “the price is the price” -- we won’t ask for unusual discounts for ourselves with strange terms like participating preferred equity. We are flexible as to whether our investment is structured as convertible debt or as equity. 

No, not every VC wants to own 30% of your company. In fact, we think at seed stages too much ownership by the early investors can ruin the cap table -- making it difficult for the founders to make money, or later investors to own enough of the company when the company needs bigger dollars to scale.

We believe in transparency. If a startup that takes our money wants to publicize the terms of our investment, we’d generally support that. (Of course we’d never disclose anything confidential without consent, and we expect the same of our founders.)

The average pre-money valuation of our recent investments was $7M, though the range was wide depending on the company's state (with valuations ranging from $2-15M. (We update this number from time to time, at a pace that avoids inadvertently disclosing the terms of any one deal. This average includes only investments where we were the first money into a company -- we lack a way to make our small number of later-stage investments comparable.)

While we’d like to claim that the amount of work we do on behalf of a company will vary dramatically based on our ownership interest, we’re not sure that is true yet -- the reality is that the amount of work we do for a company depends most of all on how much the company needs and wants our help. If they ask us to work for them, we do what we can to help.

### 其他投资者

We don’t care whether we are the lead investor or not. While we prefer to co-invest with others (who can help support a company in difficult times, and bring more expertise to bear), we have invested in situations where we are the only investor. We have also invested in situations where we own such a miniscule percentage of a company that it rounds to zero.

When we do co-invest, we care who a company’s other investors are, because the investors form an extended team around a company -- and we want our companies to have the best teams possible. We get concerned when we see situations with many investors, none of whom have a significant stake, because we worry that none will actually work to help the company.

### 谈判

We can commit to terms on just a [handshake](https://www.ycombinator.com/handshake/) as opposed to a formal term sheet (which we're happy to write when founders want them).

We only want founders to hire us as their investor after careful consideration of the alternatives, with as full information as possible. So we're allergic to "exploding offers" (where proposed investment terms expire on a set date) -- in fact we have never made one. Investors and founders enter a marriage from which there is no divorce, so while it's important to choose quickly, it's also a one-way door and it's essential to choose well. 

### Following on

Because we have relatively big funds (compared to the size of our initial checks), we do devote an unusually large proportion of our funds' resources to following on. We will deploy our capital over the usual length of time for a fund: three years or so for all our initial investments, and then follow-on capital after that. One of the benefits of having a single LP with a long term focus is that we avoid setting a specific timetable for expected returns.

We won’t follow on in every investment, but if we are excited about putting in more money, we might want to follow on for 5x our initial investment -- or more. That said, there will also be situations where a company evolves in a way where -- even though it is still a great company -- it would benefit more from another investor’s capital than from ours, so we might not always follow on in great companies.

Unlike our initial investments (where we have an "anyone can say yes" [policy](https://github.com/Bloomberg-Beta/Manual/blob/master/1%20-%20Manual.md#how-we-decide)), our follow-investments are consensus-driven decisions. Therefore, we have a much more structured [process](http://tiny.cc/betafollowons), where we typically ask founders to present their latest plans to the entire team.

### “常规条款”

We believe investors should get a “1x liquidation preference” -- in other words, if the company ends up being worth less than the value that we invested at, we should be able to at least get our money back.

We want to protect your confidentiality and ours, and usually include a standard term to accomplish that -- though the best protection is trust.

## 我们的“产品,” 或者说, 我们如何与创始人共事

We think of our “products” as offerings of support and capital to a company, and the price we charge is ownership in a company.

### “种子”
Our preference is to be the first money into a company, and to contribute a meaningful amount of capital. This is the core of what we do, and it reflects roughly 90% of the dollars we invest. We want to be able to add capital, sometimes even increasing our ownership stake, as the company evolves. While we lack a specific ownership percentage target, we try to get meaningful ownership given the stage of the company -- in practice, this can be 5-15% depending on how far the company’s progressed. (It’s difficult to generalize because, in startups, exceptions are the rule. We also find that hard ownership targets can make it more difficult to form a syndicate with other investors who can be helpful.)

### "Open Angels"
We created the Open Angels program to deepen relationships with a handful of angels we trust. We back every deal our Open Angels do at a fixed ratio with their personal investment. We are not direct investors in their portfolio companies and each Angel manages their relationship with companies. Our intent is to support people we trust, and extend our fund to support many more companies, not to create direct deal flow for us. (In fact, sometimes our Open Angels might invest in companies competitive to ones in our portfolio -- since we have no visibility into details about those companies, and we're obligated to back them if our Open Angels do, we can continue to serve our portfolio companies effectively. We treat this situation the same way as if we'd invested in a venture fund that backed a startup competitive to one of ours.)

Our Open Angels include [Ivan Kirigin](https://angel.co/ivan-kirigin/syndicate/), [Amir Shevat](https://angel.co/invest-with-amir-shevat/syndicate), [Max Simkoff](https://angel.co/max-simkoff/syndicate), [Jim Greer](https://angel.co/jim-greer/syndicate), [Michael Wellman](https://angel.co/mwellman-virgilsecurity-com), [Parker Thompson](https://angel.co/pt/syndicate), [Dennis Pilarinos](https://angel.co/dennis-pilarinos-s-syndicate/syndicate), and [Edith Harbaugh](https://angel.co/edith-harbaugh-angel-fund/angel-fund).

### "Beacon"
We believe that there are exceptional individuals with great ideas who likely have the skills to build a company but lack the network or personal financial means to get started. So we will invest a small amount of capital -- $50K (for roughly 2% of the startup idea you pursue) -- to support very, very early-stage founders explore an idea, validate a key hypothesis, or build an early prototype. Given the low cost of building software today, these small checks are intended to help founders test new ideas cheaply while avoiding excess dilution too early. We also believe that these investments have potential to increase diversity in the founder community, an effort we support through our [Future Founders](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/02/upshot/the-next-mark-zuckerberg-is-not-who-you-might-think.html) program. In our experience, the very best founders know how to experiment, iterate, and we were inspired to experiment backing people as soon as we can possibly justify it. [Read more on the why, what we look for, and deal terms here.](https://medium.com/@minnkim/introducing-bloomberg-beta-beacon-52a65e5cba82)

### “Flag”
In some cases, we only seek to put a small amount of money to work (for example, in rounds where the founder is fortunate to have many investors who want to support the company, or it is a later-stage company), and it is unlikely we will invest more. In these cases, our support is as much symbolic as it is financial -- we want to be part of something, even though we know it is unlikely to be an investment that is meaningful to our fund financially. A typical check for these investments might be $50K. While these investments have access to all the services we offer our portfolio, given our lower ownership stake we’re less able to pay proactive attention to these companies and we want to set clear expectations up front about what kinds of startups the founder will likely consider competitive.

## 我们如何支持创始人

The founders we back are our customers. We aspire to be the most useful investors per minute spent with us, and per dollar on the cap table. We want founders to want to work with us even if we weren't investors offering them money. (Though, for us to be willing to advise, we'd need the same level of conviction that we have when we're willing to invest.)

We want to work with startups the way they work, not the way that big companies or traditional investors work. We prefer to take the formality out of the investor-founder relationship. Instead of requesting board seats and scheduling formulaic calls, we share with founders and encourage them to reach out to us when we can help. We've supported founders with everything from customer introductions to helping hire a critical new team member to sharing product feedback to thinking strategically about press. Consider us “on speed dial.” We try to cut waste out of the process; starting a company is hard enough. If you want regular check-ins, sure.

Our team works closely together -- we speak often and love helping each other, and we each know the full portfolio -- so every portfolio company has access to every member of our team. We think this is different to some other venture firms we’ve met -- we try to be a “no dysfunction” partner to you.

### 那些我们最有可能帮上的领域

While we’re happy to help companies across the full range of early-stage company questions -- recruiting (how to seal the deal for a critical early hire?), fundraising (should I take more money or call it a day?), services (who do I use for HR?) -- we concentrate on the range of skills loosely called “going to market.” Our focus on the future of work means that we may know your market well, or your business model.

To us, going to market includes finding product-market fit, segmenting your market, sequencing your approaches to potential users or customers, pricing, understanding when to review and when to ignore the competition, using the various organic marketing tools, paid marketing, press, partnerships, planning to raise more capital, and just the overall understanding of the importance of communicating who you are and why you are. We have many views here that startups find surprising.

We bridge multiple professional worlds -- technical, financial, corporate, philanthropic, political, social, and otherwise. We try to bring founders across those bridges early and often, with introductions to leaders in any of those fields and group discussions to share ideas and lessons learned that are applicable to startups.

We have presence in both San Francisco and New York. We've found that SF-based founders appreciate introductions to customers in New York -- we can open that door. We make a concerted effort to help the transition from “west to east” and “east to west.”

We don’t care about face time -- you won’t get a “hey let’s have coffee just to catch up” every two weeks. We do spring into action when we see the Bat Signal. We take feedback from companies on what they want. Some of our companies have asked us to do monthly, or even weekly, meetings with them, others “go into hiding” while working on their product -- we’re good either way.

Because we sometimes create our own products, we stay current on tactical trends and may know them firsthand. If you're building something that we can use on our team, we'll share product feedback and be your biggest advocate. We believe founders have as much wisdom as investors (or more) -- we’re all just trying to spark something great in this big wide world.

One thing many founders don’t realize is how little direct control their investors ultimately have -- we can’t demand certain information from you unless it’s specifically written into our agreements (where we often ask only for general financial information), we won’t be able to make you hire or fire anyone -- we work with you based on mutual trust.

### 我们最可能这样与你交流

It varies. In some cases most of our communication is by email and chat, others where we do a regularly-scheduled call, others where we meet in person from time to time -- it just depends on what the founder wants. At minimum, we generally like to know the number one thing we can help a company with at a given time so we can focus on that.

We appreciate getting regular investment updates (e.g., a monthly email) from companies we back, since it creates a background of good understanding that helps us help you. In practice, about two-thirds of companies we back are in this habit.

What makes a good written update for investors?
* A summary (sentence!) that helps us understand how you're doing at trying to accomplish the most important thing for your startup right now -- usually we think in terms of [the risks you're trying to address](https://also.roybahat.com/instead-of-a-business-plan-write-a-thesis-plan-6de9de59daaf)
* Usually, that means the one operational metric you believe tells the story of where you are, and how that metric changed since last time you communicated it (and relative to your expectations)
* What you’re most excited about now
* How you’re doing financially (cash left, burn)
* Team additions or changes
* Where you want help from us!

Here is a [sample anonymized update](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xykbjs0KnhdA2qYdvY_jm21QJdS35iETouNNe2nARJA/edit).

Even better than an update intended for investors is a passive way to keep us updated (i.e., something that requires no incremental work). If you send a weekly internal update, copying us is great; if you use a team collaboration tool (Slack, Trello, Telegram, a Skype chat, etc.) we’d love to be included and take it as a great sign of trust; we even subscribe to private Github repos.

### 如何最好地利用我们的资源

What gets us going is helping companies realize their potential. We are happiest when we are “in it” with you, introducing you to customers, helping close candidates, whiteboarding a set of features, pushing back on your plan to announce your fancy new product release, or getting that late night call that you think things aren’t working out with the person you just spent six months to recruit. We feed off your enthusiasm, and hope to help you build even more of it.

We intend to earn the trust of Bloomberg Beta founders. We commit to being available to you whenever you want to talk. We try to notice when it’s "a moment," and especially important to lead with empathy. We recognize that issues around the personal finances of founders are particularly important and often go undiscussed -- [something we would like to change, so we can better serve founders](https://medium.com/@roybahat/for-founders-and-investors-its-time-for-real-talk-about-money-b669ae467f92). We commit to treating founders' personal financial information, when they share it with us, with confidentiality and respect. We intend to use our knowledge to help you and your companies.

We also know startups are not all roses and sunshine, even for the best of companies. We aspire to be most helpful to you when times are tough.

Investing, to us, is really nothing more than the mechanism we use to find a way to work with you. We are more comfortable talking about new product launches than about how to optimize our allocation of capital across our portfolio.

### 我们举办的活动

We invite founders to many events. We believe one way we can help companies is just by getting them out of the building. We get our founders together every so often with an extended group of our friends, and with each other. Once founders start to see familiar faces, they understand that we're building a community of mutual support. These events are completely optional, and sometimes have no direct usefulness at all (like our monthly game of [Werewolf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia_(party_game)) in San Francisco).

To bring worlds together, often we'll bring in an author, or a senior government official or business leader, or even an artist, to expose founders to ideas and people from outside the technology startup world. We invite portfolio company founders to every event, and some are only for them. When possible, we try to include the broader community in events we convene.

### Each other

Now that we have a critical mass of companies in our portfolio, the companies can be helpful to each other should they want to be -- vendor referrals, emotional support, product tips, etc.

We were one of the first (if not the first) fund to set up a portfolio community channel on Slack, even before Slack supported this functionality natively. Our founders congratulate each other, promote one another's successes, support each other through tough spots, offer tactical recommendations ("who should I use as an accountant?") in ways much more immediate, varied, and specific than our fund could do for any of them directly.

We noticed the conversations in that channel were surprisingly specific -- less about the big picture and more about what kind of paintbrush to use. We were inspired by the Picasso quote that only art critics talk about the Big Ideas, real artists help each other find [cheap turpentine](https://www.highly.co/hl/56e6f2323533356aeb5a0000). So we created an event series, "Turpentine Talks," where one of our founders who has expertise in a certain area (e.g., growth, building open source communities, hacking personal use of time) leads a roundtable discussion with other founders learning and offering their own experiences. 

We admire and want to continue to support these kinds of communities, that openly share a craft to hone the trade of companybuilding, with a particular set of companies that share a similar way of working and similar values. This kind of community is itself part of the future (and the past) of work done well.

### 学习

We recognize that founders don’t have the time to plan for their own professional growth and learning, so we offer them some of that. We might do a training on how to create useful communication with technical teams, or invite founders to a panel on a subject we think they might care about. Founders can [request](https://goo.gl/forms/qS1dehJQW5vFxYYs1) Turpentine Talks on topics of particular interest to them, of course.

### How our fund works with Bloomberg L.P.

We look for opportunities to connect startups (including our portfolio companies and others) with Bloomberg L.P. -- we invest significant time in understanding what Bloomberg may be interested in seeing. In practice, we refer more companies to Bloomberg that are not our portfolio companies, than are portfolio companies. And at the moment only one-fourth of our portfolio companies have business contact with Bloomberg. Bloomberg Beta would never be a party to a business relationship between a startup and Bloomberg L.P.; those relationships are all at arms’ length.

There are areas where access to Bloomberg may be enormously helpful to a startup. For example, some areas where Bloomberg has some of the best expertise in the world: the creation of a data-driven subscription business, selected technical specialties, high-touch customer service.

That said, we are set up as a separate legal entity to protect the confidentiality of startups with whom we work.

While Bloomberg will only work with your startup if it makes sense for Bloomberg (no, you can’t have a discount on a Bloomberg terminal), we understand how to facilitate the right conversation quickly.

We have an Advisory Committee at Bloomberg L.P. that hears from us about common themes we see, gives us input and feedback, and approves unusually big checks -- just like the LP Advisory Committee for any venture fund.

### 退出投资之后

We are disciplined about learning from every company. We will write up a retrospective report where we evaluate our value added to the team -- vs. what we wish we could have added. We assess whether we were right on the risks the company faced, and what lessons we learned. Most important, we ask whether the founder would have asked for our money again.

Capital that we earn will go back to Bloomberg L.P., and therefore to [Bloomberg Philanthropies](https://www.bloomberg.org/) where they focus on five key areas for creating lasting change: the arts, education, the environment, government innovation, and public health.

### 公司给我们的反馈

Once a year we ask all our founders to do a short anonymous survey to give us feedback on what we can do better. We calculate a Net Promoter Score as part of this. We use that NPS as the most important metric to drive our fund's choices.

We would share our Net Promoter Score here, but we don’t want our founders to feel we are using their feedback to market ourselves. (Though we’d be happy to tell you in person.)

Always be learning from your customers -- ours are founders.

If you don’t know how to find us, figure it out. Great founders overcome much more than that. If you can't, you don’t know how to use the internet and you should probably rethink whether being a founder is the right career for you.

### 如何联系我们

Should you send us a cold email? Probably not. If we were a customer of yours, would you email us cold? Wouldn’t you rather try to find someone in common? If you have to resort to a cold email, which great people sometimes do, at least show us that you took the time to exhaust the available sources of information first. Write an interesting headline. Tell us you read this…sentence…right…here.

### 创始人应该知道的一些事情

Things that won't work:
* A first email that says “My round is closing next week. Do you have interest?” We understand that founders are eager to close their funding rounds. Sometimes timing doesn’t work -- we have no fear of the elevator doors closing on us. That said, we always try to imagine how we'd behave with any company if there *were* enormous time pressure to decide (founder time is precious) -- and behave that way regardless.
* “You can only try our product if you invest.” If the product isn’t ready, we understand that. But if it is ready and we can’t play with it, we can't figure out whether to work with you.

We will turn down investing in a startup that is a known competitor today to one of our portfolio companies. If you pitch us, and we think one of our founders might find it competitive, or you might find one of our investments (especially an un-announced one) competitive, we'll tell you that we think there is a risk and (in as much as we can share) why. Then, if you want to continue talking, we'll agree with you on what we can share with the other founder (and then, vice versa) to assess the risk of a competitive issue as openly as possible. 

We recognize that competition issues can be complicated. Our intent is to respect the interests of our portfolio companies, and the confidentiality of every startup with which we communicate.

### 你为何应该从我们这儿融资

We wrote this manual so you could understand how we work, and see if you want our money. We hope this manual achieved that, and that we can avoid repeating it all right here.

### 感谢

We all move fast, and prefer to spend our time on things that matter. So if you read this, and if you spend time with us, we hope that -- whether or not we work together -- you find it worth it.
